	<div class="descrip"><p>Hello,
	Iam Anita Kimanzi Currently Student At Akirachix Oganisation,Nairobi-Kenya;.
	</p></div>
		<h2>Experience at Akirachix</h2>
        	<p>I am glad to be a student at AkiraChix,I would first like to thank and Congratulate AkiraChix for the work that they have done, to change the world through increasing the number of women in IT to balance the gender in the field of technology which have helped in reducing poverty and enpowering women to participate in devolution and innovention.IT has never been in my mind since i was young i always dreamt of doing something else,but when this opportunity came i had to try and see what it really could contribute to my life.Now hear i am as a beginner having learned alot i never thought i will get used to.I appreciate Akirachix's effort and the only way to prove my appreciation is by doing something that shalll stand out in as a product from AkiraChix. I Will work hard to meet my expectatoin being a great graphic designer as well as a Front-end developer.I will facus with a aim of being an expert in front-end developement and designer as well.</p>

		<h3>My hobbies</h3>
			<p>I like watching soaps and  listening to Bongo music,This is a way of self recharge after spending the whole day in creative clouds and web tools trying to learn something new everyday to add up to the percentage of knowledge.
    	
		<h3>My habit</h3>
			<p>I cant stay a single day without writing a code,I have tried to minimise the time used in codding but still I find myself using more hour everyday.It is know ending to a point of going on 24/7 codding.Think this is what has made me good front-end developer</p>

		<h4>My future expectation </h4>
			<p>I aspire to learn more and more on my own to shine on the world and prove to the world that it all requires efforts and self moltivation to succeed in this men dominating world. </p>

		<h3 style="margin-left:200px;">Quotes of Enpowerment</h3>
			<div class="quote"><p  style="color:#212F3D;">“There is an easy way to silence your critics; just try to do what they say you can't do. If they are still not content, do more of it! Keep doing it until you become a master. Then look around, and you will see fewer critics and many compliments!” </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">“A woman is the full circle. Within her is the power to create, nurture and transform.” </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">"I love to see a young girl go out and grab the world by the lapels. Life’s a bitch. You’ve got to go out and kick ass." </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">"It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent." </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">"No one can make you feel inferior without your consent." </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">“I’ve come to believe that each of us has a personal calling that’s as unique as a fingerprint – and that the best way to succeed is to discover what you love and then find a way to offer it to others in the form of service, working hard, and also allowing the energy of the universe to lead you.”</p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">“I always did something I was a little not ready to do. I think that’s how you grow. When there’s that moment of ‘Wow, I’m not really sure I can do this,’ and you push through those moments, that’s when you have a breakthrough.” </p>
			<p style="color:#212F3D;">“A strong woman understands that the gifts such as logic, decisiveness, and strength are just as feminine as intuition and emotional connection. She values and uses all of her gifts.” </p></div>
